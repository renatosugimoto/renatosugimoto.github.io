*Why I decided to create my own blog on Github Pages with Jekyll instead of using popular platforms like Medium, Dev.to, or Hackernoon.*

When I first came up with the idea of creating a blog, Medium seemed the right choice. Popular platform, no concerns about hosting or configuration. I could just start writing.

But I stopped for a moment and decided to do a little research on Medium. And I found some concerns about the paywall, user tracking, and other issues. This already made me rethink the idea.

Then, I also found this article called [Medium Was Never Meant to Be a Part of the Developer Ecosystem](https://dev.to/devteam/medium-was-never-meant-to-be-a-part-of-the-developer-ecosystem-25a0), and it made me see how all the Medium restrictions and policies actually make it harder for us developers to find the information we need.

After that, I gave up on Medium.
# OK, Medium is not fit for Developers. But what about the other platforms?

The research about Medium made me cautious about the others as well. So I did my research on each of the platforms, but different from Medium, I didn't find anything to be concerned about.

Actually, reading the "About" section for both [Dev.to](https://dev.to/about) and [Hackernoon](https://www.about.hackernoon.com/) I found out they both have good policies and the goal of having an open space for developers to share knowledge. And I was really considering writing directly in one of those.

That was when I found a post about [Why you should not publish content on Dev.to](https://slashgear.github.io/stop-dev-to/) and why we should follow the POSSE principle.

> Publish (on your) Own Site, Syndicate Elsewhere

After reading that, I started to like the idea of having my own blog and using Dev.to and Hackernoon to share it.

# But why not WordPress or any other CMS?

Well, I had my experience with WordPress years ago. Setting up a host for it, plus all the trouble for the configuration didn't seem worth it.

Then I remembered GitHub Pages and the fact that it supports Jekyll. GitHub would provide free hosting, and Jekyll would allow me to blog by simply committing markdown files.

**Free hosting with custom domain support, plus being able to blog from my IDE?** That sounded really good.

So I decided to give it a try. And with only 2 hours I got it up and running. (most of the time was spent deciding on the theme)

Now, here I am, writing my first post.

# Conclusion (TL;DR)

If you are writing to help other developers, Medium, with its paywall and other limitations, doesn't seem the right platform for it.

Dev.to and Hackernoon are good platforms for developers. And I definitely recommend those if you don't want the trouble of hosting your blog, worrying about a theme, and so on.

But if you want the advantages of actually owning your content, without spending too much time setting up a host and configuring a blogging tool, GitHub Pages and Jekyll might be a good choice for you, and you can still use Dev.to and Hackernoon to share your content.
