Why I decided to create my own blog with Jekyll instead of using popular platforms like Medium, Dev.to, or Hackernoon.

I’ve been thinking for a while about making a blog to write about software development, post tutorials, and how-tos. And when the idea first came up, Medium seemed the right choice. Popular platform, no concerns about hosting or configuration.

But before I started, I did a little research on Medium and found some concerns about the paywall, user tracking, and so on. It was also when I found this article called Medium Was Never Meant to Be a Part of the Developer Ecosystem.
